I left the girls with my wife and family and headed out solo to the Jackson Hole ski mountain to try and do some scrambling. A few years earlier someone had recommended Cody Peak as a good spot to build my scrambling skills, and I'd been hoping to get back ever since.

With the tram out of commission due to COVID, I took the high-speed gondola up and huffed my way up hill.
