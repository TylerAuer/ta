Are you prepared for your first engineering job? If you are a self-taught coder, this question can feel overwhelming. There are so many technologies and concepts to learn. It can feel like you'll never know enough.

The only answer to your question is that you are ready when someone hires you. And, different companies or even different people at the same companies will expect different things.

But that's not a particularly helpful answer, and I'd like to be at least a little helpful here. So, I thought I would share a summary of what I knew when I got my first opportunity: an internship at Nextdoor.

This is just a single data-point. It's definitely **not** a suggestion about what to learn or how well to learn them. It's more to provide a sense of scale of the volume of ideas you I needed to land something with someone. But, take even that with a grain of salt. It's certainly possible that I could have landed a job knowing far less. Again, one single data point here.

So here's what I knew when I got my first opportunity. I really tried to list _everything_ and roughly sorted them in the order of importance and value.

## JavaScript

I am comfortable with JavaScript. I've seen most of the common patterns and know some of the less-frequently used parts of the standard library. I know about differences between its different versions, know what a closure is, and grok promises. Maybe most importantly, I know how to use [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) to get answers for things I don't know. I understand what people mean when they say JavaScript is dynamically typed and interpreted. I am certainly not an expert, but I feel confident working in JavaScript.

## React

React is the technology I know best after JavaScript. I use functional components, write my own hooks, and utilize libraries like Emotion for CSS-in-JS, Recoil for state management, and React-router for routing. I know common patterns and how to resolve common issues. I could, for example, quickly build a to-do app without referencing the docs.

Yet, I still feel like I have a lot to learn with React, particularly in architecting a DRY and robust system. As I develop apps I can sense that some of my components grow too large or that I haven't separated concerns fully or in a logical way.

## HTML + CSS + Sass/SCSS

I understand how HTML and CSS are utilized to render web pages. I know the most common HTML tags and CSS solutions for things like centering. I don't know too much about supporting older browsers, though I do have a sense for what is an is not support. I can use breakpoints to make designs responsive. I often use BEM for class names and prefer to use Scss for its simplicity and readability. I have some sense about how CSS determines specificity, but mostly just can identify when it is the source of an issue.

## Git & GitHub

I use Git and GitHub with all of my projects. I use branches to isolate and then merge feature changes through pull requests. I can also set up GitHub actions to run tests or other scripts at specific times. I've also used git hooks for things like providing a warning before committing directly to the main branch. I still get confused when I want to revert changes or check out older branches and need to learn more about how GitHub branching and pull requests are used when working as part of a team.

## Browser Dev Tools

I use the developer tools in Chrome and Firefox to troubleshoot and solve problems. I can try out CSS for instant visual feedback, view requests, and see cookies & local storage. I also regularly use the console for testing simple examples to better understand JavaScript. I don't use it often, but I know I can add `debugger` to my JS code to stop its execution at a specific point in the browser.
