<DropCapP>
  If you are learning JavaScript, you might not be aware that there are multiple versions of the
  language. That may not seem like a big deal. After all, almost everything on computers is
  versioned. Maybe you are used to applications updating automatically. Your computer and phone
  update to new versions all the time and not much seems to change, right?
</DropCapP>

JavaScripts versions are a bigger deal. And, it's not obvious why. Let's get into it!

## Your JavaScript code does not run on your device

When you build a site with JavaScript, your code is sent to a user's computer where it is run by their browser.[^1] JavaScript is an interpreted language (as opposed to compiled into machine code) and the user's web browser is what interprets the code you've written.

[^1]: That's not exactly the whole story. When you test your site on your computer, obviously you are running the code on your machine. Also, nowadays JavaScript can run outside of the browser. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) lets you write JS on your server and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) lets you design desktop applications in JavaScript. That's one reason JS is a great language to learn, it can be used in so many different places!

The problem is that not everyone uses the same browser. And different browsers sometimes interpret your code differently. To make matters worse, many users fail to update their browsers regularly (if ever). So users will be running your code using all different versions of different browsers. This is not an insignificant issue.

One reason browsers get updated is so that they can learn to interpret features of JavaScript that get added in new versions of the language. So why bother to update JavaScript when it causes this confusion? Why not just stick with the same old version of JavaScript?

## Why are there different versions of JavaScript?

Programming languages evolve over time. Developers fix bugs and add new features. This is a good thing. The new features can make your life as a developer much easier.

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and was adopted by The European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) in 1997 which is why it is sometimes referred to as [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/tc39.htm).

<Block>
  People use two different names to refer to the editions. For example, ES6 and ECMA2015 refer to
  the same versions. I'll stick with the latter since I think the year it was adopted is useful
  context. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp">w3schools</a> has a great table
  summarizing the editions.
</Block>

Since then it's gone through a number of editions, each adding new features that make it easier for developers like you to build robust and engaging websites. Many functions you'll use often are relatively new to JavaScript.

- `JSON.parse()` wasn't added until ECMA2009
- `let` and `const` weren't added until ECMA2015
- `async` and `await` weren't added until ECMA2017

We really don't want to be writing code without some of these more modern features. But, we also know that some people's browsers will not interpret these commands correctly (or at all). So, what can we do?

## So What are we Supposed to do?

If you are just learning, probably nothing. You've got enough to figure out to get your applications to run in a modern, up-to-date browser. Focus on making your application work in the best case scenario. Then, as you learn more, you can refactor and expand the browsers you support.

Plus, when it comes to features like `let` and `const` from ECMA2015, you can rely on _most_ browsers to support them. [Can I use ...](https://caniuse.com/#home) is a great site to help you see what percentage of users will be able to handle a given feature. At the time of writing, 94.11% of users will be good with you using `let`.

If you are a company, however, you might start to care if five or ten percent of your customers can't use your site. This is an even bigger issue if your target users are in certain countries or regions. In China, for example, only 81.67% of users' browsers support `let`. Yikes! That's nearly one-fifth of your potential customers!

Luckily there are tools that help with this. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a well known one. Babel automatically turns a file written with fancy-schmancy, new JS features into one written with old-school JavaScript. Here's a quick example I put into Babel's [Try It Out](https://babeljs.io/repl) feature:

<!-- Link for adding line highlighting -->
<!-- https://prince.dev/highlight-with-react -->

<!-- An example of how Babel transpiles -->

```js
// My code before Babel converts it
const adjectives = ['cool', 'human', 'bad at choosing adjectives'];

adjectives.forEach((adj) => {
  console.log(`Tyler is ${adj}`);
});

// My code after Babel converts it
('use strict');

var adjectives = ['cool', 'human', 'bad at choosing adjectives'];
adjectives.forEach(function (adj) {
  console.log('Tyler is '.concat(adj));
});
```

Notice that `const` was replaced with `var`, my arrow function had its syntax changed, and the [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) now uses `string.concat()`. Babel did all of this conversion work for me, something I'd really appreciate if my code was longer and more complex.

As a new developer, itâ€™s good to be aware that there are multiple versions of JavaScript. When looking at Stack Overflow or documentation, you might see some examples that use older features like `var`. Just knowing why the differences exist and what to Google for help is a powerful bit of knowledge.
